    Oh, I started this game, where you spell words, but with a twist.
If you are typing a word, like pop, it may auto add an o after you type o, so it would be poop and you would get it wrong.
And there are like 10 different tricks it can do on you. (edited)

Like changing the word in the middle of you typing <br/>
[2:10 PM]
Like doubling every character you type <br/>
[2:10 PM]
Or changing the keymapings <br/>
[2:11 PM]
Should we just finish that game? (edited) <br/>

    So, it would be games with big twists, like inverted controls, or enemy gets larger everytime you kill it and smaller everytime you heal it, plus more
<br/>
And then the spelling games
<br/>
And then writing code but having to do it in fard lang or something else silly
